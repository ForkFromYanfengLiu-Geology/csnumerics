## Usage

*CSNumerics* is a Portable Class Library (PCL) of various numerical algorithms written in C#. 

It currently consists of C# implementations of Michael J.D. Powell's optimization algorithms:

* [BOBYQA](https://github.com/cureos/csnumerics/wiki/BOBYQA) for minimizing a nonlinear objective function subject to variable bounds.
* [LINCOA](https://github.com/cureos/csnumerics/wiki/LINCOA) for minimizing a nonlinear objective function subject to linear constraints.
* [COBYLA](https://github.com/cureos/csnumerics/wiki/COBYLA) for minimizing a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear constraints.

The *CSNumerics* assembly is immediately applicable with the following targets:

* .NET Framework 4 and later
* Windows Store apps (Windows 8 and later)
* Windows Phone Silverlight 8 and 8.1
* Windows Phone 8.1
* Silverlight 5
* Xamarin.iOS
* Xamarin.Android
